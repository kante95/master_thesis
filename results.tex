\chapter{Experimental results}
This chapter collects all the experimental results obtained during the thesis. Apart from the AOD characterization, there are two main sections. The first one contains the measurements carried out on the test setup done to asses the performance of the system. Here, polarization, stability, and focus spot has been checked. In particular, two methods have been used to measure $\mu$m focus spot: razor blade scans, and small pixel size camera. The other section comprises more advanced quantum optic experiments realized with ions and the final installed system. Ramsey spectroscopy was used to check addressing error and focus spot. Moreover, photons have been generated from one single ion with adjacent unperturbed ions.

\section{AOD}
The AOD is the core element of the setup, it is therefore essential to characterize it. The two main parameters we are interested in are the diffraction efficiency and the response time. For the diffraction efficiency we measure the total output power of the light $P_{tot}$ and then the power of the first diffracted order $P_{1}$. Diffraction efficiency is defined as the ratio between the two.
\begin{equation}
\text{DE} = \frac{P_1}{P_{tot}}.
\end{equation}
Before measuring the diffraction, the optimal RF power to drive the AOD has been found. This was done by measuring the power at the central frequency of the AOD and maximizing the light in the first diffracted order. Power measurements of the light were done with a Thorlabs PM100D, and the AOD was driven with a signal generator. The optimal RF power was found to be 0.11 W, and for the rest of the measurements it was kept as that value. Furthermore, the input polarization was optimized with a half wave plate, always trying to maximize the power of the diffracted light. In figure \ref{DE} the plot of the diffraction efficiency as a function of the RF frequency is displayed. Within a bandwidth of 50 MHz from 105 MHz to 155 MHz, we can see that more than 70 \% of the light is in the first diffracted order as expected from the datasheet, even though the bandwidth looks shifted with respected to the nominal central frequency of 120 MHz.\\
The response time is the time that it takes for the light to move when the RF frequency is changed. In order to perform this measurement, a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) was used to generate the RF signal. The VCO was supplied a square wave that jumped between two voltages corresponding to two different frequencies. The blue light was measured with a photodiode. The photodiode was aligned with the light at one particular frequency, such that when the light moves, the beam would not hit the chip and the signal generated changes. In figure \ref{response}, the signal of the photodiode, together with the supplied VCO signal are plotted. Response time is $\sim 7-8\,\mu$s, in this time the light completely move from one angle to another one.

\section{Full test setup characterization}
The test setup was built on a spare optical table with a spare objective. The layout of the setup was as close as possible to the final version, so the system in figure \ref{addressingsetup} was replicated. The most important assessment was the focus spot, i.e. we tried to measure the waist of the beam and check if it was within requirements.
This is measured in two different ways: first we used a technique called Knife-edge, where the beam is scanned with a razor blade; then we also tried to measure it directly with a camera equipped with 1.6 $\mu$m pixel size.\\
Other than the waist size, we also measured stability of the system and the polarization capabilities.

\subsection{Waist: Knife-Edge method}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale = 1.1]{razorsetup}
\caption{Scheme of the razor scan.}
\label{razorscan}
\end{figure}
Measuring a micrometer waist is not easy task, the first approach we tried consists of mounting a razor blade on a translational stage. The stage is then moved in the $x$ direction cutting the beam perpendicularly such that the blade is scanning the beam profile. The setup used is showed in figure \ref{razorscan}, after the objective the blade is present, and since the beam is quickly diverging after the focus, a lens is used to refocus the light into a photodiode. A filter was also inserted in order to not saturate the photodiode.
In the $z$ direction the stage was controlled with a manual screw with resolution of $1\,\mu$m. While in the $x$ direction, the stage had to be moved with sub-micrometer precision, so the screw was a piezo actuator controlled by custom software. The same software also controlled a multimeter that measured the voltage of the photodiode. To get the whole profile of the beam, i.e. $W(z)$, the measurement procedure was as follow
\begin{itemize}
\item Position blade at appropriate $z$ coordinate
\item Scanning beam in $x$ direction with blade
\item Beam width extrapolation
\item Shift $z$ direction
\end{itemize}
And the procedure is repeated for sufficient values of $z$ to scan at least few Raylegh ranges. The beam width can be calculated from the scans by fitting the data with \cite{knifeedge}
\begin{equation}
P(x,z) = \frac{P_0}{2}\text{erfc}\left[\frac{\sqrt{2}(x-x_0)}{W(z)} \right].
\end{equation}
Where the fitting parameters are $P_0, x_0,$ and the width $W(z)$. An example of scan is in figure \ref{examplerazorscan}. The errorbars comes from statistical average, every data point is a mean over 5 measurement, and the error is the standard deviation. The fit in this case gave a width of $3.47\pm 0.06\,\mu$m, the smallest width obtained with this method. Unfortunately, it is broader that the initial expectations. Furthermore, the profile $W(z)$ did not look symmetric and could not be fitted with equation \eqref{waistprofile}. A possible explanation is that this method is not suitable for measuring micrometer waists with a razor blade, the roughness of the surface could limit the result. In comparison, authors of \cite{Cannon:86} have used, instead of a common razor blade, a glass substrate etched with an effective knife-edge feature.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Waist: Camera}
Since the Knife-Edge method did not demonstrate particularly effective, if not to give an upper bound to the waist, a more direct approach has been subsequently adopted. We look directly into the beam with a camera from IDS model UI-1490LE-M-GL. This particular camera has a pixel size of 1.6 $\mu$m, with no pixel-pixel distance. It should therefore be suitable to measure a focus spot better than the razor blade. A $\mu$m focus should hit one single pixel, and if aligned between two pixels, a Gaussian profile could also be fitted.
In addition, unlike the Knife-Edge technique, a camera provides 2-dimensional information about the beam shape and can be exploited to look for aberrations in the system. The setup is almost the same as figure \ref{razorscan}, but the camera now replaces the razor blade, and there is no need for scanning in the $x$ direction, as the $z$ is enough to reconstruct the profile $W(z)$. An additional gradient filter was used to optimize the light reaching the camera in order to not saturate it and get a visible signal.
\begin{figure}
     \centering

         %\label{fig:three sin x}

     \end{subfigure}
        \caption{}
       \label{fig:camera}
\end{figure}
The measurement procedure is also similar to the Knife-Edge case. For every desired $z$ displacement, a photo with the camera is taken, post processed, and then the camera is displaced to the new $z$ coordinate. Post processing is done by fitting the pixel values with a 2-dimensional Gaussian
\begin{equation}
P = A \exp\left\{-\frac{(x-x_0)^2}{2\sigma_x^2}\right\} \exp\left\{-\frac{(y-y_0)^2}{2\sigma_y^2} \right\}.
\end{equation}
The fit parameters are $A,x_0,y_0,\sigma_x,$ and $\sigma_y$. From the standard deviation $\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_y$ the width $W(z)$ in the $x$ and $y$ direction can be determined as $W_x = 2\cdot 1.6\cdot \sigma_x$ and respectively $W_y = 2\cdot 1.6\cdot \sigma_y$, where $1.6\,\mu$m is the pixel size.
In figure \ref{fig:camera}, an example of the measurement taken is displayed. The full profiles $W_x(z)$ and $W_{y}(z)$ can be found in figure \ref{cameraprofile}. Even here anomalies can be noticed. The profile is asymmetric and does not follow equation \ref{waistprofile}, however a width $<2.5\,\mu$m has been measured. There could be some reasons behind this result, in some camera pictures some aberrations were visible. Moreover, some estimation error lead to non ideal placement of the lenses. Nonetheless, the smallest measured waist was satisfactory and enough for proceeding with the installation and doing more advanced experiments. But first few more characteristics of the system had to be tested, namely polarization and stability.

\subsection{Polarization characterization}
As discussed in the design section, polarization is an important component of the Raman process, thus the polarization capabilities of the system had to be tested. The goal is to achieve vertical, horizontal, left circular, and right circular polarization at the ion position. Polarization can be changed with two plates: a half wave plate after the AOD, and a quarter wave plate right before the objective, see figure \ref{addressingsetup}. In order to characterize the polarization, the three Stokes parameters \cite{stokes} has been measured with a polarimeter from Sc\"after + Kirchhoff series SK010PA. Stokes parameters quantify the type of polarization of an electric field. Linear polarized light (vertical and horizontal) has all Stokes parameters set to 0, apart from the first one. Instead, the third parameter, when the others are zero, contains information about circular polarized light which goes from right to left. By rotating a plate and fitting a sine function to the appropriate Stokes parameter, it is possible to gain insights on the appropriate angle to set in order to obtain the desired polarization.\\
 The first step was to characterize the $\lambda/2$ plate alone, the main result from this characterization is that horizontal polarization can be achieved with an angle of $267.2\pm 0.1 ^{\circ}$, and vertical is achieved with an angle of $312.5\pm0.1^{\circ}$ obtained from fitting a sine on the first Stokes parameter. From the same fit, the semiperiod of the polarization is $45.3\pm 0.6^\circ$.\\
As the mirror can change the polarization, the same characterization has been done after the mirror finding that the polarization is altered unless it is either horizontal or vertical.
However the main result was obtained when the $\lambda/4$ was characterized. With every plate inserted, two measurements were made. In the first one the $\lambda/2$ was set to $267^\circ$ to get horizontal polarization, and the angle of the $\lambda/4$ scanned. This result is presented in figure \ref{pol1}. The third Stokes parameter is fitted with a sine function to get the angles at which the polarization is right and left circular. The right circular polarization is obtained at the maximum of the curve, while the left corresponds to the minimum. Moreover, when the third Stokes parameter is zero, the polarization results linear. The results are shown in table \ref{polarizationstable}.
The second measurement also scanned the angle of the $\lambda/4$ plate, but this time the $\lambda/2$ was set to $312^\circ$ such that the polarization before the $\lambda/4$ plate was vertical. In figure \ref{pol2} the data is displayed. Again, to get the angle for the different polarizations, a sine function was fitted to the third Stokes parameter. The results yielded by the fit are summarized in table \ref{polarizationstable}.
