\section*{Abstract}
The purpose of this work is to build an optical system that enables single ion experiments in a linear Paul trap.
% Ions are separated typically by 4-6 $\mu$m, hence a laser must be focused more narrowly in order to control one single ion in a crystal.
In this thesis a focusing setup for a 393nm laser is designed, simulated, and ultimately built. The setup comprises of an acousto-optical deflector (AOD), for steering the beam in the microsecond timescale, and a set of lenses for expansion and control of the laser beam, which is focused in the trap by a custom objective. Our experiment traps $^{40}\text{Ca}^+$ ions, that can be used for quantum computing and as a node in a quantum network. The 393nm laser in calcium implements two operations: a phase shift qubit gate by driving the transition in the far detuned regime, and single photon generation via a cavity enhanced Raman process. We report two experiments that demonstrate these two operations. The first experiment applied the qubit gate to a single ion in a 4-ion string, the phase shift is measured with a Ramsey interferometer. In addition to demonstrate single qubit manipulation, this experiment also allows for a measure of the focus spot of the laser: 1.2-1.3 $\mu$m with an upper bound of the addressing error of $10^{-3}$. The second experiment generated single photons out of a single ion in a string opening up new possibilities for our quantum network node.

\chapter{Introduction} % section/chapter name
The next natural step in technology advancement is represented by quantum technology, as it offers a radically new approach for computation, communication, simulation, and metrology \cite{quantumtech}. All of these fields can greatly flourish with the development of quantum computers and quantum networks. Classical computers are limited in solving some particular problems that scale exponentially, and therefore a new approach is needed. Quantum computing can exploit particular features of quantum mechanics that have no classical counterparts, this allows for a speed up for a certain class of problems such as factorizing numbers \cite{shor}, or searching in a database \cite{grover}. Moreover, simulating nature at its quantum level is a hard task for classical computer, while quantum computers are naturally prone to simulate quantum dynamics.\\
Quantum networks also bring new additional features, and several benefits to communication. The concept of a quantum internet is to have a quantum channel along side with the classical channel, enabling the transmission of quantum information \cite{Wehnereaam9288}. The task of building a quantum network is not trivial, as there are fundamental differences with a classical link. Although the medium can be the same, such as optical fiber, a quantum network must have additional abilities, such as distributing entanglement, or transmitting quantum states. However, once achieved, quantum networks have several applications: cryptographic wise they allow for more secure information transmission through Quantum Key Distribution \cite{qkd2}, secure identification \cite{secureident}, blind quantum computation \cite{blindcomputation} and more \cite{Wehnereaam9288}. Outside cryptography, quantum networks finds applications in metrology: entanglement can be exploited to improve clock synchronization \cite{quantumclocks},
and extend telescope's baseline  \cite{telescope}. Furthermore, quantum networks offer more efficient solutions to distributed system problems \cite{distributedcomputing}.\\
A set of criteria exists to assess the viability of a realistic implementation of quantum computers and quantum networks \cite{divincenzo}, several platforms have been proposed and implemented trying to satisfy these criteria. Ion trapping has already fulfilled all criteria experimentally \cite{trappedions} and it shows great potential for a possible large scale quantum computer. The idea is simple, qubits are encoded in the electronic state of single trapped ion in a Paul trap. Manipulation can be done with laser pulses \cite{ionquantumcomputer} and by placing a cavity, an ion trap gains a controllable network interface \cite{stuteinterface}.\\
However, still a lot of challenges needs to be addressed for a quantum computer to outperform a classical one. Due to the incredible delicate nature of qubits, they are subject to decoherence which harms the successfulness and computational power of quantum computers. Therefore, scaling the number of qubit has been proven to be a difficult engineeristic challenge. Several solutions are possible: the number of qubits can scale; the dimension of qubits can decrease; or qubits can be linked together. The last solution is the approach at the base of quantum networks. The idea is to link several quantum computers to create a cluster of nodes that can work jointly.\\
It is in this context that this thesis arises. Currently there is an ongoing project of building a three node quantum network between two buildings on the campus of the University of Innsbruck. The third node is located in IQOQI, where the thesis took place. Here an ion trap is used as node of the network and it is connected to the other traps via a 400m fiber link. A 393nm lasers is responsible for the generation of the transmitted photons via a cavity enhanced Raman process \cite{stuteinterface}. At the time of this thesis' start, the 393nm laser was shining on every ion in the trap. In this case, if an ion string were to be loaded, the light would couple to every ions and there would be no control over the single ion-photon pair. An addressing setup enables the generation of single photons from individual ions which opens up several possibilities in computer-network interfacing: multi-ion-multi-photon states can be generated, a quantum node gains quantum memory capabilities, and the possibility of multiplexing increases drastically the network bandwidth.

To overcome this limitation, an optical setup for the 393nm laser had to be built with the purpose of focusing the light to a single ion in a string. Moreover, the setup should have the ability to steer the beam on a fast scale $\sim\mu$s and focus it on a different ion. The goal of this thesis was to design and build such a system. The setup is per se not complex, but the design is critical, ions separation is typical in the order of $\mu$m, which means the light should be focused down to $1-2\,\mu$m, at the limits of the optical elements involved. The steering part is achieved with an acousto-optical deflector (AOD), such device deflects the laser light on microsecond timescales proportionally to the applied input frequency allowing to control remotely the beam pointing of the system.\\
Once completed, the system will allow to manipulate single ions in a string in two different ways differentiated by the laser regime. Hence, the final goal of the thesis is to perform two experiments that demonstrate the functionalities of the system:\vspace{-1em}\newline

The first experiment is photon generation, a single laser pulse can trigger the generation of a single photon in a cavity via a Raman process \cite{stuteinterface}. The process requires the addressed ion to be coupled to the cavity electric field,
both the cavity and the laser pulse must be correctly detuned to suppress spontaneous scattering and maximize the probability of photon production. With the AOD the laser pulse is steered and aimed at different ions in $\mu$s time, thus enabling the creation of photon trains. This enriches the capabilities of the interface between the ion quantum computer and the photonic network channel, as outlined above.\vspace{-1em}\newline

The second experiment is qubit manipulation. A phase gate \cite{chuang} over a single qubit is implemented. In the off resonant regime, the laser induces AC Stark shift on the $\ket{0}$ state of the qubit, shifting the relative phase of the qubit state. In order to measure the AC Stark shift we want to perform Ramsey interferometry \cite{starkshift}, where between the two $\pi/2$ pulses a detuned Stark pulse is introduced. This pulse shift the relative phase of the qubit and therefore the amount of Stark shift can be inferred from the final qubit state. The gate is part of the universal set of quantum gates \cite{chuang}, and it is therefore a building block of a full implementation of a quantum computer.

This work is presented in the following way: Chapter 2 is devoted to the theoretical background necessary to understand the rest of the work. Here the foundations of quantum computing and networking are laid down, along with the basic concepts of ion trapping, and Gaussian beams; Chapter 3 presents the existing experimental setup, i.e. the already built and working blocks of the experiment where the setup designed in this thesis has been added; Chapter 4 is the core of the thesis, here the final design made with the software Zemax and simulations of different aspects of the project are introduced and presented;
Chapter 5 contains all the experimental results obtained. It is divided in two parts: First, the setup was built on a spare optical table, here we had the freedom to test different key properties of the performance of the system and decide whether or not it was satisfactory. After having the certainty that the system will work, the setup was transferred and aligned on the main experiment where limited access did not allow for easy performance testing. Here, different and more advanced experimental quantum optics methods had to be used to check if the system was working properly. The description and discussion of these results are in the second part of chapter 5. Lastly, in chapter 6 a conclusion with a summery and a future outlook is given.
