\section*{Abstract}
An ongoing project of building a three node quantum network is currently being carried out at the university of Innsbruck with ion traps being the nodes of the network. The ion traps all feature an integrated optical cavity for enhanced photon collection efficiency. To make entanglement between ions located in the three nodes, control over multiple ion-photon pairs is required in at least one of the nodes. In this thesis I present the design and implementation of a tightly-focused laser system that allows many ions in a string to be connected with many propagating photons. The optical system focuses a 393 nm laser down to address individual ions in the string and uses an acousto-optic deflector (AOD) for steering the focus to different ions in a string on the microsecond timescale. Our experiment traps $^{40}\text{Ca}^+$ ions, the 393 nm laser triggers the generation of a photon via a cavity enhanced Raman process. The photon is emitted in a cavity and leaks out from one side.
The designed setup comprises of an AOD, for steering the beam on the microsecond timescale, a set of lenses for expansion and control of the laser beam, and a custom objective for focusing the light on the ions. The system was designed and simulated with the software Zemax, and ultimately built on top of the existing experiment. We report two experiments that demonstrate the capabilities of the setup. The first experiment generated photons from a single ion in a string without changing the state of the other ions. In the second experiment we applied a phase gate on a single ion-qubit, the phase shift induced is measured with a Ramsey interferometer. In addition to realizing single qubit manipulation capability in our ion-trap for the first time, this experiment allowed for a measure of the focus spot: 1.2-1.3 $\mu$m (1/$e^2$ intensity radius) with an upper bound on the addressing error of $10^{-2}$ for a 4 ion string confined with a trap frequency of 767 kHz. These experiments are a stepping stone towards the realization of the aforementioned quantum network, the next key experiment is already ongoing, photons are produced from different ions creating a photon train. Afterwards, entanglement between ion and photon has to be achieved for each ion-photon pair.

\chapter{Introduction} % section/chapter name
%A next step in technological advancement is represented by quantum technology, which
Quantum technology offers radically new approaches for the fields of computation, communication, simulation, and metrology \cite{quantumtech}. For example, classical computers are limited in solving a range of important problems such a factorization, due to an exponential increase in computing time with the problem size. Quantum computers, however, exploit particular features of quantum mechanics that have no classical counterparts to solve the factorization problem with sub-exponential resources in problem size \cite{shor}. Moreover, simulating nature at its quantum level is a hard task for a classical computer, while quantum computers are naturally prone to the efficient simulation of quantum dynamics \cite{RevModPhys.86.153}.\par
A collection of distributed \emph{nodes}, that are each quantum computers, that are interconnected via quantum channels forms a fully fledged quantum network \cite{kimble}. However, for some quantum network applications, it is possible to relax the condition of having a universal quantum computer at each node, a quantum device with a single qubit is enough as part of a functional quantum network with basic capabilities. As such, quantum networks are likely to provide some of the first practical applications of quantum technology \cite{Wehnereaam9288}. There are fundamental differences between a quantum channel and a classical one. Although the medium can be the same, such as optical fiber, a quantum channel must have additional abilities, such as distributing entanglement, or transmitting quantum states.\par
Quantum networks have several applications: cryptographic-wise they allow for more secure information transmission through Quantum Key Distribution \cite{qkd2}, secure identification \cite{secureident}, blind quantum computation \cite{blindcomputation} and more \cite{Wehnereaam9288}. Outside cryptography, quantum networks find applications in metrology: entanglement can be exploited to improve clock synchronization \cite{quantumclocks},
and extend telescope's baselines \cite{telescope}. Furthermore, quantum networks offer more efficient solutions to distributed system problems \cite{distributedcomputing}, and a distributed network of quantum processors is a practical way to enable scalable quantum computing \cite{PhysRevA.89.022317}.\par
This thesis lies in the context of current efforts to enable the realization of quantum networks of light and matter. Currently there is an ongoing project to build a three node quantum network between two buildings on the Technik campus of the University of Innsbruck. The quantum nodes consist of ion traps: qubits are encoded in the electronic states of ions in a Paul trap, manipulation is done with laser pulses \cite{ionquantumcomputer}, and photons are collected with an optical cavity integrated into the ion-trap vacuum system. A $400\, \text{m}$ optical fiber serves as a quantum channel between the two buildings. This quantum network should have the ability to make entanglement between all three nodes simultaneously. Our approach is to develop the ability to connect multiple ions to multiple traveling direction-switchable photons, using a single-ion-focused \emph{photon generation} beam. \par
Photons are generated via a cavity enhanced Raman process \cite{stuteinterface}, for which a 393 nm laser is used. Before this master project, the 393 nm laser was shining on every ion in the trap. In this case, if an ion string were to be loaded, the light would couple to every ion and there would be no control over the single ion-photon pair. The same 393 nm laser will also be employed to perform ion-qubit manipulation by inducing an AC Stark shift on the qubit's ground state. A single-ion-focused laser allows the manipulation of individual ion-qubits performing thus single qubit operations as explained below.\par
This thesis presents the development of an optical system that focuses the 393 nm laser beam on a single ion, and has the ability to steer the beam on a timescale of a few microseconds, which is the typical time for photon generation operations and ion-qubit operations. The setup is per se not complex, but the design is critical. Ion separation is typically around 5 micrometers in our system, so the light should be focused down to $1-2\,\mu$m, at the limits of the optical elements involved. The steering part is achieved with an acousto-optical deflector (AOD), which deflects the laser light on microsecond timescales proportionally to the applied input frequency allowing to control remotely the beam pointing of the system.
The goal of this thesis is to perform the following experiments with the newly built setup:\par\noindent%\textcolor{white}{The AOD allows single ions in a string to be manipulated}\vspace{-.5em}

\end{wrapfigure}
As illustrated in the sketch on the left, the idea is to generate photons from individual ions in a string and send them to the different nodes of the network. The laser beam is focused on a single ion, a laser pulse triggers the generation of a photon, the beam is then steered and focused on another ion to repeat the process. The approach we use is an ion-cavity system: the laser pulse triggers a cavity enhanced Raman process \cite{stuteinterface} that on resonance causes the emission of a photon from one ion into the cavity. The photon subsequently exits from a preferred cavity mirror. In this thesis we set the goal of emitting photons from a particular ion without significantly exciting any other ion in the string. This is a key step towards producing and controlling multiple photon-ion pairs. Not shown here is the relationship between the emitting ion and the standing wave of the optical cavity vacuum-field, which must also be precisely controlled.\newpage
\noindent{\large\textbf{\textsc{Thesis goal 2: single ion-qubit manipulation}}}\\
\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.4\textwidth}

    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{qubitmanipulation}
  %\caption{Schematic of photon generation}
\end{wrapfigure}
As illustrated in the sketch on the right, the same laser can perform quantum operations on the qubits encoded in the ions. Our goal is to manipulate the state of a single qubit without modifying the state of the others. Here the laser operates in a far-detuned regime, and induces an AC Stark shift on the $\ket{0} = \ket{\text{S}_{j=1/2}, m_j=-1/2}$ state of the ion-qubit implementing a phase gate on a qubit encoded in this and another electronic state \cite{chuang}. In order to measure the AC Stark shift we perform a Ramsey interferometry experiment \cite{starkshift}, where a detuned Stark pulse is introduced between the two $\pi/2$ pulses. This pulse shifts the relative phase of the qubit and therefore the amount of Stark shift can be inferred from the final qubit state.\par
The rest of this thesis is presented in the following way: Chapter 2 is devoted to the theoretical background necessary to understand the rest of the work. Here, the foundations of quantum computing and networking are laid down, along with the basic concepts of ion trapping and Gaussian laser beams; Chapter 3 presents the existing experimental setup, i.e. the already built and working blocks of the experiment where the setup designed in this thesis has been added; Chapter 4 is the core of the thesis, here the final design made with the software Zemax and simulations of different aspects of the project are introduced and presented; Chapter 5 contains all the experimental results obtained. It is divided in two parts: first, the setup was built on an optical table, here we had the freedom to test different key properties of the performance of the system and decide whether or not it was satisfactory. After having the confidence that the system can work as desired, the setup was transferred and aligned on the main experiment where limited access did not allow for easy performance testing, except that which is possible with trapped ions. Here, we carried out two experiments that demonstrate the capability of the built system: to manipulate single qubits and to generate photons from single ions (the two main goals of the thesis). The description and discussion of these results are in the second part of Chapter 5. Lastly, in Chapter 6 a conclusion with a summary and a future outlook is given.

Here we report the figures for the polarization characterization of section \ref{sec:polarization}. Every figure contains a fit of a sine function $A\sin(\omega x +\phi)$, where $x$ is the angle of the corresponding waveplate. The fits are used to determine the maxima and minima of the curves which indicates the closest point to the desired polarization, see table \ref{polarizationstable} for results.
