\chapter{Introduction} % section/chapter name

Quantum computing has been a rapidly increasing field of interest, which is probably due to the fact that it represents the
next step in technology advancement. Classical computers are limited in solving some particular problems that scale exponentially, and therefore a new approach is needed. Quantum computing can exploit particular features of quantum mechanics that have no classical counterparts, this allows for a speed up for a certain class of problems such as factorizing numbers \cite{shor}, or searching in a database \cite{grover}. Moreover, simulating nature at its quantum level is a hard task for classical computer, while quantum computers are naturally prone to simulate quantum dynamics.\\
A set of criteria exists to assess the viability of a realistic implementation of a quantum computer \cite{divincenzo}, several platforms have been proposed and implemented trying to satisfy these criteria. Ion trapping has already fulfilled all criteria experimentally and it shows great potential for a possible large scale quantum computer. The idea is simple, qubits are encoded in the electronic state of single trapped ions in a Paul trap. Manipulation can be done easily with laser pulses and by placing a cavity, an ion trap gains network abilities.\\
However, still a lot of challenges needs to be addressed for a quantum computer to outperform a classical one. Due to the incredible delicate nature of qubits, they are subject to decoherence which harms the successfulness and computational power of quantum computers. Therefore, scaling the number of qubit has been proven to be a difficult engineeristic challenge. Several solutions are possible: the number of qubits can scale; the dimension of qubits can decrease; or qubits can be linked together. The last solution is the approach at the base of quantum networks. The idea is to connected several quantum computers to create a cluster of nodes that can work jointly. The task of building a quantum network is not trivial, there are fundamental difference with a classical link. Although the mean can be the same, such as optical fiber, a quantum network must have additional abilities, such as distributing entanglement, or transmitting quantum states. In addition to scaling quantum computers, quantum networks allow for more secure transmission of information \cite{qkd}, and improve some measurements \cite{quantumclocks}.\\
It is in this context that this thesis arises. Currently there is an ongoing project of building a three node quantum network between two buildings on the campus of the University of Innsbruck. The third node is located in IQOQI, where the thesis took place. Here an ion trap is used as node of the network and it is connected with a 400m fiber link. The 393nm lasers is responsible for the generation of the transmitted photons via a cavity enhanced Raman process. At the time of this thesis' start, the 393nm laser was shining in the whole trap. In this case, if an ion string were to be loaded, the light would hit all the ions equally and there would be no control over the single ion-photon pair. This limits the experiments and the production of photons to one single ion.\\
To overcome this limitation, an optical setup for the 393nm laser had to be built with the purpose of focusing the light to a single ion in a string. Moreover the setup should have the ability to steer the beam and focus it on a different ion. The goal of this thesis was indeed to design and build such a system. The setup is per se not complex, but the design is critical, ions separation is typical in the order of $\mu$m, which means the light should be focused down to $1-2\,\mu$m, at the limits of the optical elements involved. The steering part is achieved with an acousto-optical deflector (AOD), such device deflects the laser light proportionally to the applied input frequency allowing to control remotely the beam ponting of the system.\\
 Once completed, the system will allow to manipulate single ions in a string. The same laser can manipulate ions in two different ways: we already mentioned the most important: the triggering of the photon's generation; but, by driving in the laser in a different regime, it is also possible to implement a single qubit gate. This is used to implement quantum operations that are the base for some experiments. For instance, the characterization and beam shape probing experiment performed in this thesis is built on top of such quantum operation.\\
 \newline
 This work is presented in the following way: Chapter 2 is devoted to the theoretical background necessary to understand the rest of the work. Here the foundations of quantum computing and networking are laid down, along with the basic concepts of ion trapping; Chapter 3 presents the existing experimental setup, i.e. the already built and working blocks of the experiment where the setup designed in this thesis has been added; Chapter 4 is the core of the thesis, here the final design made with the software Zemax and simulations of different aspects of the project are introduced and presented;
Chapter 5 contains all the experimental results obtained. It is divided in two parts: First, the setup was built on a spare optical table, here we had the freedom to test the performance of the system under different aspects and decide whether or not it was satisfactory. After having the certainty that the system will work, the setup was transferred and aligned on the real experiment where limited access did not consent for easy performance testing. Here, different and more complicated experimental methods had to be used to check if the system was working properly. The description and discussion of these results are in the second part of chapter 5.
