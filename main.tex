\section*{Abstract}
An ongoing project of building a three node quantum network is currently carried out at the university of Innsbruck with ion traps being the nodes of the network. To make entanglement between ions located in the three nodes, control over multiple ion-photon pairs is required. A laser beam has to focused down to a single ion to generate photons out of individual ions in a string. In this thesis, an optical system is designed and built for focusing and steering the laser beam responsible for the photon generation process. Our experiment traps $^{40}\text{Ca}^+$ ions, the 393 nm laser triggers the generation of a photon via a cavity enhanced Raman process. The photon is emitted in a cavity and leaks out from one side.
The designed setup comprises of an AOD, for steering the beam in the microsecond timescale, a set of lenses for expansion and control of the laser beam, and a custom objective for focusing the light on the ions. The system was designed and simulated with the software Zemax, and ultimately built on top of the existing experiment. We report two experiments that demonstrate the capabilities of the newly built setup. The first experiment generated photons out of a single ion in a string without exciting the ions not involved in the process. In the second experiment we applied a phase gate on a single ion-qubit, the phase shift induced is measured with a Ramsey interferometer. In addition to demonstrate single qubit manipulation capability, this experiment also allowed for a measure of the focus spot: 1.2-1.3 $\mu$m with an upper bound on the addressing error of $10^{-3}$. These experiments are a stepping stone towards the realization of the aforementioned quantum network, the next key experiment is already ongoing, photons are produced from different ions creating a photon train. Afterwards, entanglement between ion and photon has to be achieved for each ion-photon pair.

\chapter{Introduction} % section/chapter name
A next step in technology advancement is represented by quantum technology, as it offers a radically new approach for the fields of computation, communication, simulation, and metrology \cite{quantumtech}. For example, classical computers are limited in solving some particular problems that scale exponentially, and therefore a new approach is needed. Quantum computing can exploit particular features of quantum mechanics that have no classical counterparts, this allows for a speed up for a certain class of problems such as factorizing numbers \cite{shor}, or searching in a database \cite{grover}. Moreover, simulating nature at its quantum level is a hard task for classical computer, while quantum computers are naturally prone to simulate quantum dynamics \cite{RevModPhys.86.153}.\\
A collection of quantum computers interconnected via quantum channels forms a fully fledged quantum network \cite{kimble}. However, for some quantum network applications, it is possible to relax the condition of having a universal quantum computer, a quantum device with a single qubit is enough as part of a functional quantum network with basic capabilities \cite{Wehnereaam9288}. The concept of a quantum internet is to have a quantum channel along side with the classical channel, enabling the transmission of quantum information \cite{Wehnereaam9288}. There are fundamental differences between a quantum channel and a classical link. Although the medium can be the same, such as optical fiber, a quantum channel must have additional abilities, such as distributing entanglement, or transmitting quantum states. Quantum networks have several applications: cryptographic wise they allow for more secure information transmission through Quantum Key Distribution \cite{qkd2}, secure identification \cite{secureident}, blind quantum computation \cite{blindcomputation} and more \cite{Wehnereaam9288}. Outside cryptography, quantum networks find applications in metrology: entanglement can be exploited to improve clock synchronization \cite{quantumclocks},
and extend telescope's baselines \cite{telescope}. Furthermore, quantum networks offer more efficient solutions to distributed system problems \cite{distributedcomputing}.\\
It is in this context that this thesis arises. Currently there is an ongoing project of building a three node quantum network between two buildings on the campus of the University of Innsbruck. The quantum nodes consist of ion traps: qubits are encoded in the electronic states of ions trapped in a Paul trap, while manipulation is done with laser pulses \cite{ionquantumcomputer}. A 400 m optical fiber serves as link between the two buildings. This quantum network should have the ability to make entanglement with more than one other node in a network. This task requires the ability to connect multiple ions to multiple traveling direction-switchable photons. This is achieved with a single-ion-focused laser beam.\\ % In this thesis, an optical system was designed and built for controlling and focusing the laser beam responsible for photon generation.\\
Photons are generated via a cavity enhanced Raman process \cite{stuteinterface}, for which a 393 nm laser is used. When I started my master project, the 393 nm laser was shining on every ion in the trap. In this case, if an ion string were to be loaded, the light would couple to every ion and there would be no control over the single ion-photon pair. The same 393 nm laser is also employed to perform ion-qubit manipulation by inducing an AC Stark shift on the qubit's ground state. A single-ion-focused laser allows to manipulate individual ion-qubits performing thus single qubit operations.\\
% To get photons from individual ions in a string,
This thesis presents the development of an optical system that focuses the 393 nm laser beam on a single ion, and has the ability to steer the beam on a timescale of a few microseconds, which is the typical time for photon generation operations and ion-qubit operations. The setup is per se not complex, but the design is critical. Ions separation is typically around 5 micrometers in our system, so the light should be focused down to $1-2\,\mu$m, at the limits of the optical elements involved. The steering part is achieved with an acousto-optical deflector (AOD), which deflects the laser light on microsecond timescales proportionally to the applied input frequency allowing to control remotely the beam pointing of the system.
The AOD allows single ions in a string to be manipulated in two different ways:\textcolor{white}{The AOD allows single ions in a string to be manipulated

As illustrated in the sketch on the left, the idea is to generate photons from individual ions in a string and send them to the different nodes of the network. The laser beam is focused on a single ion, a laser pulse triggers the generation of a photon, the beam is then steered and focused on another ion to repeat the process. The approach we use is an ion-cavity system: the laser pulse triggers a cavity enhanced Raman process \cite{stuteinterface} that on resonance causes the emission of a photon from one ion into the cavity. The photon subsequently leaks out from one of the cavity mirrors. In this thesis we set the goal of emitting photons from a particular ion without exciting any other ion in the string. This is a key step towards producing and controlling multiple photon-ion pairs.

\vspace{-1.4em} The same laser can perform quantum operations on the qubits encoded in the ions. Our goal is to manipulate the state of a single qubit without modifying the state of the others. Here the laser operates in a far-detuned regime, and induces an AC Stark shift on the $\ket{0} = \ket{\text{S}_{j=1/2}, m_j=-1/2}$ state of the ion-qubit implementing a phase gate \cite{chuang}. In order to measure the AC Stark shift we perform a Ramsey interferometry experiment \cite{starkshift}, where between the two $\pi/2$ pulses a detuned Stark pulse is introduced. This pulse shifts the relative phase of the qubit and therefore the amount of Stark shift can be inferred from the final qubit state.

The rest of this thesis is presented in the following way: Chapter 2 is devoted to the theoretical background necessary to understand the rest of the work. Here, the foundations of quantum computing and networking are laid down, along with the basic concepts of ion trapping and Gaussian laser beams; Chapter 3 presents the existing experimental setup, i.e. the already built and working blocks of the experiment where the setup designed in this thesis has been added; Chapter 4 is the core of the thesis, here the final design made with the software Zemax and simulations of different aspects of the project are introduced and presented; Chapter 5 contains all the experimental results obtained. It is divided in two parts: first, the setup was built on an optical table, here we had the freedom to test different key properties of the performance of the system and decide whether or not it was satisfactory. After having the certainty that the system can work as desired, the setup was transferred and aligned on the main experiment where limited access did not allow for easy performance testing. Here, we carried out two experiments that demonstrate the capability of the built system: to manipulate single qubits and generate photons from single ions. The description and discussion of these results are in the second part of chapter 5. Lastly, in Chapter 6 a conclusion with a summary and a future outlook is given.

\chapter{Polarization characterization}
\label{app:polarization}
Here we report the figures for the polarization characterization of section \ref{sec:polarization}. Every figure contains a fit of a sine function $A\sin(\omega x +\phi)$, where $x$ is the angle of the corresponding waveplate. The fit are used to determine the maxima and minima of the curves which indicates the closest point to the desired polarization, see table \ref{polarizationstable} for results.
