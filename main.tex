\chapter{Introduction} % section/chapter name
The next natural step in technology advancement is represented by quantum technology, as it offers a radically new approach for computation, communication, simulation, and metrology \cite{quantumtech}. All of these fields can greatly flourish with the development of quantum computers and quantum networks. Classical computers are limited in solving some particular problems that scale exponentially, and therefore a new approach is needed. Quantum computing can exploit particular features of quantum mechanics that have no classical counterparts, this allows for a speed up for a certain class of problems such as factorizing numbers \cite{shor}, or searching in a database \cite{grover}. Moreover, simulating nature at its quantum level is a hard task for classical computer, while quantum computers are naturally prone to simulate quantum dynamics.\\
Quantum networks also bring new additional features, and several benefits to communication. The concept of a quantum internet is to have a quantum channel along side with the classical channel, enabling the transmission of quantum information \cite{Wehnereaam9288}. The task of building a quantum network is not trivial, as there are fundamental differences with a classical link. Although the medium can be the same, such as optical fiber, a quantum network must have additional abilities, such as distributing entanglement, or transmitting quantum states. However, once achieved, quantum networks have several applications: cryptographic wise they allow for more secure information transmission through Quantum Key Distribution \cite{qkd2}, secure identification \cite{secureident}, blind quantum computation \cite{blindcomputation} and more \cite{Wehnereaam9288}. Outside cryptography, quantum networks finds applications in metrology: entanglement can be exploited to improve clock synchronization \cite{quantumclocks},
and extend telescope's baseline  \cite{telescope}. Furthermore, quantum networks offer more efficient solutions to distributed system problems \cite{distributedcomputing}.\\
A set of criteria exists to assess the viability of a realistic implementation of quantum computers and quantum networks \cite{divincenzo}, several platforms have been proposed and implemented trying to satisfy these criteria. Ion trapping has already fulfilled all criteria experimentally \cite{trappedions} and it shows great potential for a possible large scale quantum computer. The idea is simple, qubits are encoded in the electronic state of single trapped ion in a Paul trap. Manipulation can be done with laser pulses \cite{ionquantumcomputer} and by placing a cavity, an ion trap gains network abilities \cite{stuteinterface}.\\
However, still a lot of challenges needs to be addressed for a quantum computer to outperform a classical one. Due to the incredible delicate nature of qubits, they are subject to decoherence which harms the successfulness and computational power of quantum computers. Therefore, scaling the number of qubit has been proven to be a difficult engineeristic challenge. Several solutions are possible: the number of qubits can scale; the dimension of qubits can decrease; or qubits can be linked together. The last solution is the approach at the base of quantum networks. The idea is to link several quantum computers to create a cluster of nodes that can work jointly.\\
It is in this context that this thesis arises. Currently there is an ongoing project of building a three node quantum network between two buildings on the campus of the University of Innsbruck. The third node is located in IQOQI, where the thesis took place. Here an ion trap is used as node of the network and it is connected to the other traps via a 400m fiber link. A 393nm lasers is responsible for the generation of the transmitted photons via a cavity enhanced Raman process \cite{stuteinterface}. At the time of this thesis' start, the 393nm laser was shining on every ion in the trap. In this case, if an ion string were to be loaded, the light would couple to every ions and there would be no control over the single ion-photon pair. An addressing setup enables the generation of single photons from individual ions which opens up several possibilities in computer-network interfacing: multi-ion-multi-photon states can be generated, a quantum node gains quantum memory capabilities, and the possibility of multiplexing increases drastically the network bandwidth.

To overcome this limitation, an optical setup for the 393nm laser had to be built with the purpose of focusing the light to a single ion in a string. Moreover the setup should have the ability to steer the beam on a fast scale $\sim\mu$s and focus it on a different ion. The goal of this thesis was to design and build such a system. The setup is per se not complex, but the design is critical, ions separation is typical in the order of $\mu$m, which means the light should be focused down to $1-2\,\mu$m, at the limits of the optical elements involved. The steering part is achieved with an acousto-optical deflector (AOD), such device deflects the laser light on microsecond timescales proportionally to the applied input frequency allowing to control remotely the beam ponting of the system.\\
Once completed, the system will allow to manipulate single ions in a string. The same 393nm laser can perform two different kind of manipulation by driving the laser in different regimes. The first one is photon generation, a single laser pulse can trigger the generation of a single photon in a cavity with a Raman process \cite{stuteinterface}. This implements an interface between the ion quantum computer and the photonic network channel, an essential component towards the building of a quantum network.\\
The second manipulation is a phase gate over a single qubit. In the off resonant regime, the laser induces AC stark shift on one level of the qubit, shifting the relative phase of the qubit state. The gate is part of the universal set of quantum gates \cite{chuang}, and it is therefore a building block of a full implementation of a quantum computer.

 This work is presented in the following way: Chapter 2 is devoted to the theoretical background necessary to understand the rest of the work. Here the foundations of quantum computing and networking are laid down, along with the basic concepts of ion trapping, and Gaussian beams; Chapter 3 presents the existing experimental setup, i.e. the already built and working blocks of the experiment where the setup designed in this thesis has been added; Chapter 4 is the core of the thesis, here the final design made with the software Zemax and simulations of different aspects of the project are introduced and presented;
Chapter 5 contains all the experimental results obtained. It is divided in two parts: First, the setup was built on a spare optical table, here we had the freedom to test different key properties of the performance of the system and decide whether or not it was satisfactory. After having the certainty that the system will work, the setup was transferred and aligned on the main experiment where limited access did not allow for easy performance testing. Here, different and more advanced experimental quantum optics methods had to be used to check if the system was working properly. The description and discussion of these results are in the second part of chapter 5. Lastly, in chapter 6 a conclusion with a summery and a future outlook is given.
