abstract="The Mathieu equation in its standard form6.1{\$}{\$}{\backslash}ddot x + (a - 2q{\backslash}cos 2t)x = 0{\$}{\$}is the most widely known and, in the past, most extensively treated Hill equation. In many ways this is curious since the equation eludes solution in a usable closed form; yet many investigators have sought to describe experiments in terms of a Mathieu equation, most probably only because it contains a simple sinusoid as its periodic coefficient. By association with Fourier series it may have been assumed that once solutions to the Mathieu equation had been determined, solutions to Hill equations in general would follow. Indeed, in many ways the opposite is true in the context of the methods presented in Chap. 5.",

From the results of a least-squares calculation described in Part I for all accepted experimental data, we derive here tables and graphs to replace those of 1993. The first table lists atomic masses. It is followed by a table of the influences of data on primary nuclides, a table of separation energies and reaction energies, and finally, a series of graphs of separation and decay energies. The last section in this paper lists all references to the input data used in Part I of this Ame2003 and also to the data entering the Nubase2003 evaluation (first paper in this volume).

Therefore laser cooling of trapped ions is reviewed, the current state of the art is reported, and several new cooling techniques are outlined. The principles of ion trapping and the basic concepts of laser cooling for trapped atoms are introduced. The underlying physical mechanisms are presented, and basic experiments are briefly sketched. Particular attention is paid to recent progress by elucidating several milestone experiments. In addition, a number of special cooling techniques pertaining to trapped ions are reviewed; open questions and future research lines are indicated.},

Of particular significance in this context is research in cavity quantum electrodynamics which explores quantum dynamical processes for individual atoms strongly coupled to the electromagnetic field of a resonator. An overview of the research activities in the Quantum Optics Group at Caltech is presented with an emphasis on strong coupling in cavity QED which enables exploration of a new regime of nonlinear optics with single atoms and photons.}
