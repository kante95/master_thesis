\chapter{Design and simulation of the addressing setup}
The purpose of this thesis work was to design and build the addressing setup for the already existing experiment. In this chapter we discuss the design and the implementation of such setup. The design is a crucial part of the work, there are several requirements that have to be met in order to achieve the proper needed functionality. In the first section, the requirements are presented together with an overview of the design idea. In the setup an objective was already present, ad the choice of an AOD was already made. Hence, we discuss this components as given. The rest of the setup was simulated with the software Zeemax, which was used to find the optimal optical components and their placement.
\section{Addressing system overview and requirements}
Addressing systems have already been developed and employed in experiments successfully. Different techniques are available: the main idea is to focus a laser beam tighter than ion-ion separation and steer it. In  Innsbruck calcium ions have been addressed in this way, where the steering was achieved with an AOD \cite{addressing}; Beam has also been steered with micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) mirrors \cite{addressing3}. Another idea is to send a normal beam illuminating all the ions, but hiding those who are not addressed. This was done with Ytterbium atoms where by means of a inhomogeneous magnetic field the transition frequencies were shifted shielding selected ions \cite{addressing2}. \\
Our choice was to implement the already successful idea implemented in Innsbruck with and AOD and improve it. The advantage of AODs is to have a fast switching time in the order of $\mu$s, that is used for fast switching between ions. A problem with the implementation of \cite{addressing} is however the fact that the AOD is placed right before the beam expander, this limits the addressing range, as the beam is likely to clip when it is steered on the edge of the AOD's bandwidth. This is the main problem that the new designed system, here implemented, wanted to address: exploiting the full capabilities of the AOD while maintaining a very tight focus.
Therefore, there are mainly two aspects to keep in mind, the focus spot and the addressing range.\\
The addressing setup should be able to address single ions in a string in order to generate single photons out of single ions via the already discussed Raman process. Ion separations, in the case of $^{40}\text{Ca}^+$, has been derived in section \ref{ionstrings}, for a trap frequency of 1 MHz is 5.6 $\mu$m. The setup must therefore be able to focus tightly a laser beam down to 1-2 $\mu$m. As seen in section \ref{sec_diffraction}, a tighter focus can obtained with a shorter wavelength, a bigger lens, or with shorter focal length. The focusing lens, a.k.a the objective, is shared with the imaging setup, and thus it is given, the focal length is therefore a constant in the problem. The wavelength is also a constant, as the Raman process happens only at 393 nm. This gives only one possibility left to tighten the focus, i.e. by making the beam as broad as possible at the objective input surface. Beam expansion can be achieved with a Galilean telescope, it take two lenses to form such Telescope, a concave Lenses to diverge a collimated beam and a convex lens to collimate the diverging beam. The combinations of these two lenses takes a collimated beam and expands it to another collimated beam. This expansion part is one of the two essential part of the addressing setup. The other part is related to addressing range. Not only, we want to focus the beam to a single ion, but we want to move the beam as well, such that it focuses on a different ion. Therefore, there is a requirement also on the range that can be addressed. This depends on the number of ions and their spacing, a good aim is to address tens of ions, this requires the ability to move the focus in one direction by 150-200 $\mu$m. Beam steering is possible with the use of an AOD, the detailed working principle of this device has been discussed in section \ref{theory_AOD}. Basically the angle of the output beam of the AOD changes as the driving frequency changes. However, the AOD must be placed far behind the objective to leave space for the beam expander, this implies a need to control and redirect the angle of the AOD's output beam to send it to the beam expander and later in the objective without any clipping. This task is accomplished with a pair of converging lenses, they refocus the collimated beam into the beam expander, beam then becomes wider, reaches the objective and it is focused on the ion. It is important to get the right lenses at the right distances, the objective has 5 different lenses inside and it works slightly differently from a normal lens. For instance, it does not focuses collimated blue light, but red. This means that the beam expander should not collimate completely the beam but rather expand it and leave it diverging, so that the objective can focus it at the right position. The setup displayed in figure
\ref{addressingsetup} also contains polarization optics. As discussed in section \ref{sec:ramanprocess}, Zeeman transitions are polarization sensitive, thus polarization control is required
