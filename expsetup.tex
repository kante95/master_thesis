\chapter{Existing experimental system}
The work developed in this thesis lies on top of an existing experiment. In this chapter we are going to describe the essential parts of the already existing setup on top of which the addressing system has been build. Calcium-40 ions are used in the experiment, the implementation of several techniques for
trapping and manipulating these ions are discussed. Furthermore, the addressing setup utilizes 393 nm light, the laser emitting this light was already installed and used, thus that setup is presented. The experiment can be controlled remotely via computers, an overview of how it is implemented and how it works is also given.

\section{Ion trap and key techniques}
\subsection{Calcium Ions}

Red transitions are dipole forbidden, but accessible with electric quadrupole, they are used to encode qubits. Orange transition are usually repumped. In addition, the 854 nm transition is tuned in resonance with the cavity for photon generation purposes. From more and precise value see table \ref{transitiontable}}

In choosing the appropriate ion to trap, one looks first of all for simplicity, which means choosing an element with one single electron in the most outer orbital.
This fact limits the choice to the second group of the periodic table, many of these elements has been successfully trapped: beryllium \cite{beryllium}, barium \cite{barium}, strontium \cite{strontium}, and calcium \cite{calcium}.
The latter has been chosen for this experiment, as calcium has transitions easily accessible with commercial diode and titanium-sapphire lasers. The most abundand isotope of calcium is calcium-40, which is a common choice, but not the only one \cite{Tanaka2007}. Nevertheless, $^{40}\text{Ca}^+$ ions were our choice. In figure \ref{calciumscheme} the level scheme of the only electron in the outer shell is presented. A single ground state is present $\text{S}_{1/2}$ with no hyperfine structure as $^{40}\text{Ca}^+$ does not posses a nuclear spin. There are two short lived excited states ($\sim 7$ ns): $\text{P}_{1/2}$, and $\text{P}_{3/2}$ which are accessible with dipole transitions. These states have different decay channel, for $\text{P}_{1/2}$
the branching ratios are $6\%$ to $\text{D}_{3/2}$, and $94\%$ back to the ground state. For  $\text{P}_{3/2}$ there is a probability of $5.3\%$ to decay to   $\text{D}_{5/2}$, $0.6\%$ to go to  $\text{D}_{3/2}$ and $94\%$ to return to  $\text{S}_{1/2}$. Due to the short lifetimes of these two states, they are suitable for laser cooling and state detection, while the states $\text{D}_{3/2}$ and $\text{D}_{5/2}$
are metastable ($\sim 1$ s) since accessible with electric quadrupole transition. Since the lifetime of the D states are much greater than typical coherence time, they can encode a stable qubit and manipulated without worrying about dissipative process. Table \ref{transitiontable} summarizes details about the different transitions, and what they are used for. A more detailed description and implementation is discussed in the next section.

\subsection{Trapping, cooling, and state readout}
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width = .7\textwidth]{phototrap}
\caption{Photo of the mounted trap, a pair of compensation electrodes and the mirrors of the cavity are also visible.}
\label{trapphoto}
\end{figure}
Our trap is a linear 3D RF Paul trap as depicted in figure (), the picture of the real trap is displayed in figure \ref{trapphoto}. The trap consists of 4 ortoghonal electrodes with blade shape for RF confinement in the radial direction. In the axial direction confinement is achieved with two tip electrodes that forms the endcaps. Everything is made in titanium, it is covered in gold and the trap itself is mounted vertically on a Shappire holder. The endcaps are 5 mm apart, and they are usually kept at a voltage in the order of 500-1000V, which means an axial frequency of $\omega_z \sim 2\pi \times 0.7-1$ MHz. The four blades are 0.8 mm from the center of the trap and driven with an RF of $\sim 24$ MHz. Due to the high power delivered to this blades ($\sim-4$ dBm), the RF signal has to be impedance matched with the trap, this is done with an helical resonator.
The trap also includes three pairs of compensations electrodes that can be used to compensate micromotion.
Loading of ions is done with an atomic oven, calcium is heated a directed towards the trap, in the trap the atoms undergo 2-stage photon ionization. The first laser 375 nm, excite one electron to a very high excited state, the second laser 422 nm, brings the electron to free space ionizing the atom. Such two stage process allows to filter for isotopes and ionize only $^{40}\text{Ca}$. Loading usually takes minutes or tens of minutes depending on the number of ions one wants to load. Storing time can be in the order of days, especially when a single ion is loaded.\\
Once loaded, ions are laser cooled with 397 nm light on the transition $\text{S}_{1/2} \to \text{P}_{1/2}$ detuned at $-\Gamma/2$. An additional repumper on the transition $\text{P}_{1/2} \to \text{D}_{3/2}$ is also used to avoid for the electron being stuck in the $\text{D}_{3/2}$ state. For typical experiment a stage of doppler cooling is always included, this lasts from 1 millisecond up to tens of milliseconds.\\
With the same Doppler cooling light, imaging can also be done. The light shines on the ions exciting the transition $\text{S}_{1/2} \to \text{P}_{1/2}$ driving the electron to the excited states which then decay spontaneously emitting a photons. Photon are collected with a custom objective with NA of $\sim 0.3$, which means an efficiency of 2.5 \% over the solid angle $4\pi$. The objective focuses the collected photons 1.5 meters away where a CCD camera (Andor iXon Ultra 897) is placed. The geometrical path of the imaging is displayed in figure \ref{imgsetup}, this setup has a magnification factor of $\sim$18.6. The same objective is also used for the addressing setup built within this thesis. Therefore, the imaging optical path must be partially shared with the newly built addressing. In depth overview of objective is therefore given in section ().\\
State read out is possible with this kind of imaging, with the difference of using a photonmultiplier tube (PMT) for counting photons instead of a camera. Consider a qubit encoded in the states $\text{S}_{1/2} \to \text{D}_{5/2}$, if the imaging laser is switched on, the electron will be projected either to the $\text{S}_{1/2}$ level or in the $\text{D}_{5/2} $. In the first case, photons are scattered from the ion and collected on the PMT, in the second case the electron is shelved and will not scatter any photon. Hence, the two cases are distinguishable by counting statistics. An histogram can be constructed  with the number of photon measured, and a properly set threshold differentiates between bright and dark states. Typical detection times are in the order of milliseconds.

\caption{Top view of the imaging optical path, the objective collimates and focuses the scatter photons onto the CCD camera. The addressing setup must share part of this path, as the same objective is used for focusing.}

\subsection{Photon generations}
By placing a cavity around the trap, photon generation is enabled. The cavity mediated Raman process is responsible for this phenomenon. It can be explained strating from a three level atom like in figure \ref{ramanprocess}. The electron is initially in the ground state $\ket{0}$, a laser pulse excite the transition $\text{S}_{1/2} \to \text{D}_{3/2}$ detuned properly to eliminate the population in the $\ket{e}$ level. Among the decay channels of the electron, the decay $\text{P}_{3/2} \to \text{D}_{5/2}$ is enhanced due to the presence of the cavity and therefore the coupling $g$ between the ion and the cavity mode. The electron will more likely decay
to the $\text{D}_{5/2}$ state emitting a photon inside the cavity. Thus the process can be described as $\ket{0}_i\ket{0}_p \to \ket{1}_i\ket{1}_p$ where the subscript $i$ indicates the ion and $p$ the photon number in the cavity. The detuning is set such as $\Delta \gg \Omega,g$, in this regime the whole process can be described as a single transition with effective Rabi frequency of \cite{helene}
\begin{equation}
\Omega_{eff} = \frac{\Omega g}{2\Delta}.
\end{equation}
It is equivalent of a classical Raman process driven with two laser pulses on the two different transitions, but in this case the second laser is substituted by the vacuum standing wave of the cavity. In order to avoid decay in other channels, one must be sure that $\Omega_{eff}$ is larger than the effective decay rate of other spontaneous emission $\Omega_{eff}\gg \Gamma_{eff}$. Moreover, the photon should leave the cavity after the transfer is complete, this is ensured by $\Omega_{eff} >\kappa$.\\
In the real case the electronic states are also shifted due to a magnetic field generated by a permanent magnet perpendicular to the cavity axis and at $45^{\circ}$ with respect to the trap axis. This is done in the optics of achieving ion-photon entanglement, since in that case multiple Zeeman levels should be addressed. The situation is therefore further complicated and the polarization of the laser field should be taken into consideration. In figure (), the Zeeman structure of $^{40}\text{Ca}^+$ is depicted. One can start from the state $\ket{\text{S}_{1/2},m_j = -1/2}$. From here three choices of polarization can be taken: $\sigma^-,\pi,\sigma^+$, for each choice three Raman transition are possible, the most favorable in the case of the magnetic field orthogonal to the cavity axis is \cite{stuteinterface}
\begin{equation}
\ket{\text{S}_{1/2},-1/2}\to\ket{\text{P}_{3/2},-3/2} \to \ket{\text{D}_{5/2},-5/2}.
\end{equation}
In this case the transitions strengths, i.e. the projection on the laser polarization onto the dipole moment, and the same projection onto the cavity axis are maximized.\\
The generated photon from this process can be entangled with the ion state by driving this Raman transition with a bichromatic beam. This means that the laser pulse drives two transitions at the same time, for example the one that ends up in $\ket{\text{D}_{5/2},-5/2}$ and $\ket{\text{D}_{5/2},-3/2}$. In this instance, the generated photon will be a superposition of $\sigma^+$ and $\pi$ polarization. With respect to the cavity it means vertical and horizontal polarization. The final state of the bichromatic transition is therefore
\begin{equation}
\ket{\psi} = \ket{\text{D}_{5/2},-5/2}\ket{H} + \ket{\text{D}_{5/2},-3/2}\ket{V}.
\end{equation}
In the real experiment the designed cavity is near concentric with a length of $19.9$ mm, and radii of curvature of $9.98$ mm. The cavity length is actively stabilized with a PDH type feedback which locks the mirrors position to a 806nm laser. One mirror of the cavity is highly reflective $T_1 = 2.2$ ppm, while the other is more transmissive $T_2 = 97$. This asymmetry of the mirrors allows for the produced photons to exit one from one side in most cases and subsequently coupled to a fiber. The probability to get a photon out of the cavity from the designed mirror can be determined from the transmission and losses of the cavity, the maximum achievable is $P_{max} = 0.83$. The maximum $g$ factor achievable with this geometry is $g = 2\pi \times 1.53$ MHz. The Finesse of the cavity for the TEM$_{00}$ mode is 54000. The other cavity parameters are $\kappa = 2\pi \times 70$ kHz, and $\gamma = 2\pi\times 11.45$ MHz for the $\text{P}_{3/2}$ state. With these numbers the preferred strong regime is not reached, but nonetheless,  it is still possible to produce photons and collect them out of the cavity.

\section{393nm laser}
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width = .9\textwidth]{scheme393}
\caption{393 nm optical setup.}
\label{scheme393}
\end{figure}
The laser used to drive the Raman transition is 393 nm. This light is obtained from a titanium-sapphire laser from MSquared. The laser is optically pumped with 8 W of light at 532 nm coming from a Lighthouse Photonics Sprout laser. The active Ti:Sa crystal is contained in a cavity in a bow tie configuration, together with an optical diode, etalon, birefringent mirror, and tunable cavity mirror for frequency tuning and stabilization. The fundamental mode is at 786 nm with tunability ranging from 725 nm to 875 nm that can be controlled remotely on the computer. The laser can also be locked to a wavemeter and tuned with it.
The fundamental light is frequency doubled to 393 nm via a MSquared ECD-X external cavity resonant doubler accessory module. Blue light can be obtained with up to 1 W of power. Before reaching the ion trap, 393 nm light is sent through the setup in figure \ref{scheme393}. There are two AOM's in the setup, AOM1 from Brimrose with a working frequency of 150 MHz, AOM2 is still from Brimrose and works at 80 MHz.
The first AOM1 is in double pass configuration. Diffracted light in the -1 order is sent through and reflected back again in the same AOM. While, the zeroth order is picked up and sent directly to the ion. Diffracted light from AOM1 is sent to the second AOM used in single pass configuration. The diffracted light, -1 order is coupled to a fiber that brings it to the ion trap. The zeroth order of AOM2 is blocked. Lenses in the setup have the purpose to focus the waist of the beam in the AOM's aperture avoiding unwanted beam steering and therefore losing coupling to the fiber. AOM's are used to fine tuning the laser frequency to achieved the desired detuning from the Raman transition to maximize photon generation.
